## Question

<p>Ashwin has a farm with N cows. Some cows are conscious about other cows watching them eat and therefore don't want to hog on their fodder. Suppose cow i is conscious, it is conscious about cow i-1 and cow i+1 watching it eat. Now, we can say a cow at position i is conscious if it has eaten lesser than the cows at positions i-1 and i+1, provided the cows at position i-1 and i+1 have both eaten less than 2*i units of fodder.</p>

### Input
<p>First line of input is number of test cases T

Each test case is as follows:

The first line consists of N, the number of cows.

The second line consists of N space seperated integers indicating the number of units of fodder each cow has eaten.</p>

### Output
<p>Output a line containing space seperated 0s and 1s based on whether the cow is conscious or not. 0 for not, 1 for conscious.
