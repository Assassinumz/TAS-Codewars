## Question

<p>You're given 2 positive integers A, and B. You can then apply the following operation any number of times:

* Choose an arbitrary positive integer D.
* Perform exactly one of the following actions:
    * add D to A, add D−1 to B or
    * add D−1 to A, add D to B

Is it possible after applying this operation any number of times, that you can achieve a state where A=B</p>

### Input
<p>The first line contains an integer T, denoting number of test cases.
