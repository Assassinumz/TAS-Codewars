## Question

<p>You’re given a string S with N characters, and another character X. You’re required to find the total number of sub-strings in S which contain the character X, atleast once.

Two substrings of S are considered to be different if their positions in S are different, and substrings considered are continous in nature.</p>

### Example

<p>
For S = 'abb', and X = 'b'

The substrings possible are: 'a', 'b', 'b', 'ab', 'bb', and 'abb'. Out of these 5 of these substrings contain the character 'b' atleast once.
</p>

### Input
<p>The first line denotes the number of test cases T

Each test case is of this format:

The first line consists of a single integer N.

The 2nd line consists of a string of length N, followed by a space, and then a character X.</p>

### Output
<p>
A single line containing 1 integer, the total number of substrings that contain X.
