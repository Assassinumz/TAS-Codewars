## Question

<p>Aditeya is trapped in a maze. The command center sends him a string which helps him navigate the maze. The string consists of the characters L, R, U, D denoting left, right, up and down respectively. With each command Aditeya must traverse 1 unit distance in the respective direction. For example if he is at (2, 0) and the command is L he will go to (1, 0).

Given Aditeya's initial co-ordinates, and the navigation string, output Aditeyaâ€™s final co-ordinates.</p>

### Input
<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer T signifying the number of test cases.

Each test case follows as:

First line of the test case contains 2 space seperated integers M, N indicating the initial position.

Second line of the test case contains a string S indicating the navigation string.</p>

### Output
<p>
For each test case, print "X Y" (without quotes, and single space seperated), denoting Aditeya's final co-ordinates.
</p>

### Constraints
<p>
1 <= T <= 1000

-100 <= M, N <= 100

1 <= | S | <= 1000 (Length of the string)
