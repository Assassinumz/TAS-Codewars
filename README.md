This repo contains questions and my writeup of PES University's fest(The Amateur Scientist) for the event codewars of the year 2019. [Click Here](https://github.com/RohanGautam/TAS-Codewars-solutions) for previous year's questions.

There were 2 rounds, we had 1 hour to solve 30 questions in the first round and 2 hours 30 minutes to solve 10 questions in the second round. We choosed Python for the first round and I also managed to get the C++ question set, If you've got the other question sets(C, Java) you can submit a PR :)

# Preliminary Round

The preliminary(first round) was just a pen and paper round with some MCQs on programming language of your choice (Python, C++, C, Java) and Aptitude questions, you're expected to solve 30 questions in 1 hour and the first 50 teams with the highest score/marks qualify for the finals(second round), In case of a tie in the score between two teams, the team which has submitted their solutions first will be considered.

I've provided the questions and solutions in Markdown format, solutions for the questions can be found at the end. Click on the links below for the writeup

# Final Round
The final round was well organized and the challenges were provided in [hackerearth](https://www.hackerearth.com). Every team had 2 hours 30 minutes from their start time to solve 10 challenges.<br><br>
The solutions were to be submitted in hackerearth and they were tested with a few automated test inputs, the allowed languages were again Python, C++, C & Java. The challenges ranged from 5-20 points. Click on the links below for the challenges and their solutions.<br><br>
